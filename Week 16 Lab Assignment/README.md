Three things that I learned in this ASP.NET Core MVC web programming course are how to create/start a ASP.NET MVC application, gain data from user input, and the different types of development involving code and a database.  First, we learned how to start a new project by utilizing an MVC application template, and how to add to it over time to suite our specific needs and requirements. Next, we learned how to save data from user inputs as strings and integers, set requirements for what that data can contain, and output error messages if the inputed data does not be the previously set requirements. Finally, we learned about Code First development and Database First development. Code First development creates a database utilizing entity classes and a database context classes we coded first. Database First development creates entity classes and a database context class from a pre-existing database.

Three features that can be added to this application to improve the application for users are the uses of the alternate text for images, _, and _. The use of alternate text for images on the appliocation would improve the functionality of the website for users that may be visually-impaired, while also assisting users that may be having trouble loading the images displayed on the website.
