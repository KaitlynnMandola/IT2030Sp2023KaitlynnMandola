  The type of retail web application that I will be creating for this course will be within the "Computers and IT Accessories" category. The name of this retail web application will be "Kaitlynn's Keyboards and Kilobytes". 

  The purpose of this retail web application is so that clients can access this application via the Internet. By being able to access it, they can view and browse the information stored on the web application, while also being able to interact with in. The information stored would includes retail items' names, prices, available, and descriptions. The various retail items would be sorted based on their characteristics, within different categories that the clients can interact with by selecting which categories and item the want to view. Other client interactions would include the process of placing an order to purchase selected retail items (i.e. adding to cart, changing quantities, calculating subtotals, calculating sales tax, calculating final totals, adding payment methods) and contacting the retailer (i.e. selecting reason for contacting, inputing responses into supplied text fields). The retail application would consist of multiple pages such as a home page, an "About Us" page, a "Contact Us" page, pages contain the various available retail items, a "Cart" page, any necessary "Checkout" pages, and a "Thank You for Ordering / Confirmation Number" page.
